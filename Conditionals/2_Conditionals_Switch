Switch is a good replacement to long else if constructs.

int x = 2;

switch(x)                                                        checks if x==1
{
	case 1: printf("x is 1");
		break;                                           if x==1 condition is satisfied and there
        case 2: printf("x is 2");                                is no break after printf then subsequent
                break;                                           expression will also get evaluated until
        case 3: printf("x is 3");                                we reach the next break.
                break;
        default: printf("x is a number besides 1, 2, and 3");    if none of the cases are satisfied then
                break;                                           default will be executed. Default is optional.
}

FACTS RELATED TO SWITCH
=======================
1. You are not allowed to add duplicate cases.

2. Only those expressions are allowed in switch which results in integral constant value.
int a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;              float a = 1.15, b = 2.0, c = 3.0;
switch(a+b*c) is allowed              switch(a+b*c) is not allowed

3. Float value is not allowed as a constant value in case label. Only integer constants/constant expressions are allowed in case label.
	case 2.14:             case 2+2*5:
	is not allowed         is allowed

4. Variable expressions are not allowed in case labels. Although macros are allowed.
int y = 5;                     #define y 5
        case y:                case y:
	is not allowed         is allowed

5. Default can be placed anywhere inside switch. It will still get evaluated if no match is found.
	default:
	case 1:
	case 2:
	is OK
